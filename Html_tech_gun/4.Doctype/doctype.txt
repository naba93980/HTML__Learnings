html is not the only type of document used in browser,
there are many other type of document like mathml, svg

<!DOCTYPE html>

tells the browser that the document is of type html5.

<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> is not actually an element or HTML tag. It lets the browser know how the document should be interpreted, 
    by indicating what version or standard of HTML is being used.-->

<!--The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect-->

<!--
    
In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition, i.e definition of the type the document is of ).

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

if we dont declare the doctype then the browser will read entire file only after that it will understand 
what is the type of the document, and then render the webpage as per the rules of that document type.
so it will take more time.
if we declare doctype at the beginning then broswer will know right from beggining 
what rules based on doctype to apply to render the webpage.
