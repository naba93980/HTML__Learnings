Open Graph (OG) tags are placed in the <head> section of a page and allow any webpage to become a rich object in social networks.

In HTML, it can look like this:
<meta name="og:title" property="og:title" content="Your Open Graph Title Goes Here">

SEO value:

OG tags let you control how the information about your page is represented when shared via social channels. 
This possibility may help you enhance the performance of your links on social media, thus driving more click-throughs and increasing conversions.

There are quite a few Open Graph tags:

OG title: 
Yep, that’s another tag with the title of your page. So now you have three different titles: one is for search (title tag- title of the webpage document), one is for your website (H1), and  the third one is for social networks (OG title). You can copy any of the other titles and keep things simple or you can come up with a separate title for social sharing.
Keep in mind that it should be between 60-90 characters, otherwise, it may be truncated.

OG type:
Use this tag to describe what kind of object you are sharing: a website, post, video, company, etc. http://ogp.me/#types
This tag is considered important when your page has the Like button. It may help to determine whether your content will appear in the Facebook user's interest section in case she or he "Likes" it.
In most cases, the type is "website", because you mostly share links to websites. If so, you do not need to specify the type in the code, it will be read as such by default.

OG description:
This one is very similar to the meta description tag. However, it won't be displayed in SERPs, it will be shown as the summary when your page is shared. For this reason, there is no point in craftily sneaking your keywords into this particular description.
Your main task here is to make it speak to your potential audience and drive more clicks.

OG image:
An image will make your shareable link much more attractive. Some text over the image is acceptable, but try to place it in the middle of an image, as some platforms will trim the edges. 
The recommended resolution for the OG image is 1200x627 pixels, the size — up to 5MB.
Once you are done with your OG meta tags, you can check how everything looks like with the help of Open Graph Object Debugger, a tool created by Facebook.

Twitter cards:
Twitter cards are very similar to OG tags (title, description, image, etc.), but they are used exclusively by Twitter. Though now tweets can exceed 140 characters, these cards are a nice extension that allows your tweet to stand out in the crowd of common text tweets.
