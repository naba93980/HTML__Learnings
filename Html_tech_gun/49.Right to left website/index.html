<!--

An attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text, i.e if the visible content in the webpage is from right to left or left to right direction.


It can have the following values:

ltr, which means left to right and is to be used for languages that are written from the left to the right (like English);
rtl, which means right to left and is to be used for languages that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);


The lang global attribute helps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable elements are written in, or the language that the editable elements should be written in by the user. 
The default value of lang is unknown, therefore it is recommended to always specify this attribute with the appropriate value.

Always use a language attribute on the html tag to declare the default language of the text in the page. This is inherited by all other elements. For example:
<html lang="en">

Note that you should use the html element rather than the body element, since the body element doesn't cover the text inside the document's head element.

*****When the page contains content or any user given 'attribute value' in another language, add a language attribute 
"to an element surrounding that content".*****


For example:

<p>The title is "<span lang="fr">Le Bon Usage</span>"</p>.
