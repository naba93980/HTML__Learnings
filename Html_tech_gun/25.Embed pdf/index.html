<iframe>
The iframe element represents a nested browsing context. HTML 5 standard - "The <iframe> element"
Primarily used to include resources from other domains or subdomains but can be used to include content from the same domain as well. 
The <iframe>'s strength is that the embedded code is 'live' and can communicate with the parent document.

<!--

<embed>
Standardised in HTML 5, before that it was a non standard tag, which admittedly was implemented by all major browsers. 
Behaviour prior to HTML 5 can vary.
The embed element provides an integration point for an external (typically non-HTML) application or interactive content. 
Used to embed content for browser plugins.

<!--

<object>
The <object> element can represent an external resource, which, depending on the type of the resource, will either be treated as an image,
as a nested browsing context, or as an external resource to be processed by a plugin.

<!--

A browsing context is the environment in which a browser displays a Document. In modern browsers, it usually is a tab, 
but can be a window or even only parts of a page, like a frame or an iframe.

-->

<!--

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, 
which is the DOM tree.
The DOM tree includes elements such as <body> and <table>, among many others.
