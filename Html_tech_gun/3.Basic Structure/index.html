<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--tells the browser what type of document this file is, doctype html means this document is of type html5-->

<!-- The DOCTYPE is not actually an element or HTML tag. It lets the browser know how the document should be interpreted, 
    by indicating what version or standard of HTML (or other markup language) is being used.-->

<!--The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect-->

<!--
    
In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition, i.e definition of the type the document is of ).
