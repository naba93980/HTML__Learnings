When the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:

application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified.

Default. All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)


multipart/form-data: The value used for an <input> element with the type attribute set to "file".


text/plain: (HTML5) Sends data without any encoding at all. Not recommended.


This value can be overridden by a formenctype attribute on a <button> or <input> element.
